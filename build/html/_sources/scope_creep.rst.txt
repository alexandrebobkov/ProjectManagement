=====================================
Scope Creep
=====================================

**Key Features:**

A realistic mobile app development project that students can relate to
Three progressive rounds of change requests that increase in complexity and timing challenges
Structured decision matrices to track choices and reasoning
Impact analysis tools to see cumulative effects of decisions
Reflection questions that connect the simulation to real-world project management principles

**Educational Design Elements:**

Change requests come from different stakeholders with varying levels of authority
Requests range from reasonable safety features to nice-to-have additions
Timing creates realistic pressure (early changes vs. late-stage requests)
Some requests appear mandatory while others are clearly optional
Budget and time constraints force difficult trade-off decisions

**Learning Outcomes:**

Students experience how small changes accumulate into major scope issues
They practice evaluating change requests against project constraints
They learn to distinguish between essential and optional changes
They develop skills in stakeholder communication and expectation management

Learning Objectives
-------------------------------------------------

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

  - Recognize scope creep in project scenarios
  - Evaluate change requests against project constraints
  - Apply change management principles in decision-making
  - Understand the impact of scope changes on project success

Initial Project Definition
------------------------------

Project: Student Mobile App Development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your team has been contracted to develop a mobile app for your university's student services.

**Original Scope:**
- Class schedule viewer
- Grade checker
- Campus map with building locations
- Dining hall hours and menus
- Basic user authentication

**Approved Budget:** $25,000
**Timeline:** 4 months (16 weeks)
**Team Size:** 4 developers
**Platform:** iOS only
**Target Users:** 8,000 students

**Success Criteria:**
- App launches successfully in App Store
- 70% of students download within first month
- User satisfaction rating of 4.0+ stars
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities

Round 1: Week 2 Change Requests
--------------------------------

**Instructions:** Your team has just completed the requirements gathering phase. Review each change request below and make decisions using the Decision Matrix.

Change Request #1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**From:** Student Government President
**Request:** Add push notifications for campus emergency alerts
**Justification:** "This is critical for student safety and would significantly increase app usage."
**Impact:** +1 week development time, +$2,000 cost

Change Request #2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**From:** Athletic Department
**Request:** Include sports schedules and ticket purchasing
**Justification:** "We have 15,000 season ticket holders who would love this feature."
**Impact:** +2 weeks development time, +$4,500 cost, requires integration with ticketing system

Decision Matrix - Round 1
