=====================================
Scope Creep
=====================================

**Key Features:**

  - A realistic mobile app development project that students can relate to. Three progressive rounds of change requests that increase in complexity and timing challenges. Structured decision matrices to track choices and reasoning.
  - Impact analysis tools to see cumulative effects of decisions. Reflection questions that connect the simulation to real-world project management principles.

**Educational Design Elements:**

  - Change requests come from different stakeholders with varying levels of authority.
  - Requests range from reasonable safety features to nice-to-have additions.
  - Timing creates realistic pressure (early changes vs. late-stage requests).
  - Some requests appear mandatory while others are clearly optional.
  - Budget and time constraints force difficult trade-off decisions.

**Learning Outcomes:**

  - Students experience how small changes accumulate into major scope issues.
  - They practice evaluating change requests against project constraints.
  - They learn to distinguish between essential and optional changes.
  - They develop skills in stakeholder communication and expectation management.

Learning Objectives
-------------------------------------------------

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

  - Recognize scope creep in project scenarios
  - Evaluate change requests against project constraints
  - Apply change management principles in decision-making
  - Understand the impact of scope changes on project success
