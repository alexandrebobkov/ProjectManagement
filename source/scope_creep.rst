=====================================
Scope Creep
=====================================

Key Features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A realistic mobile app development project that students can relate to
Three progressive rounds of change requests that increase in complexity and timing challenges
Structured decision matrices to track choices and reasoning
Impact analysis tools to see cumulative effects of decisions
Reflection questions that connect the simulation to real-world project management principles

Educational Design Elements:

Change requests come from different stakeholders with varying levels of authority
Requests range from reasonable safety features to nice-to-have additions
Timing creates realistic pressure (early changes vs. late-stage requests)
Some requests appear mandatory while others are clearly optional
Budget and time constraints force difficult trade-off decisions

Learning Outcomes:

Students experience how small changes accumulate into major scope issues
They practice evaluating change requests against project constraints
They learn to distinguish between essential and optional changes
They develop skills in stakeholder communication and expectation management

Learning Objectives

  - Recognize scope creep in project scenarios
  - Evaluate change requests against project constraints
  - Apply change management principles in decision-making
  - Understand the impact of scope changes on project success
