## Part 2: Stakeholder Analysis Matrix (20 minutes)

**Instructions:** Plot each stakeholder on the matrix below based on their level of influence (ability to impact project success with performance) and interest (how much the project affects them).

### Influence/Interest Matrix

```
HIGH INTEREST
│
│  Keep Satisfied        │  Manage Closely
│  (Low Influence,       │  (High Influence,
│   High Interest)       │   High Interest)
│                        │
│                        │
├────────────────────────┼────────────────────────
│                        │
│                        │
│  Monitor               │  Keep Informed
│  (Low Influence,       │  (High Influence,
│   Low Interest)        │   Low Interest)
│                        │
└────────────────────────┴────────────────────────► HIGH INFLUENCE
```

**Quadrant Definitions:**
- **Manage Closely:** High influence, high interest - key stakeholders requiring active management
