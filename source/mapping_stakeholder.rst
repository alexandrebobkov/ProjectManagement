=====================================
Project Stakeholder Mapping
=====================================

The handout includes:

  - Clear learning objectives tied to project definition skills
  - A realistic campus sustainability project scenario that students can relate to
  - Step-by-step activities progressing from identification to analysis to planning
  - Visual tools like the influence/interest matrix
  - Structured templates for documentation
  - Reflection questions to deepen learning
  - A presentation component for peer sharing

The exercise is designed to take about 50-60 minutes total, making it suitable for a standard class period. The scenario is complex enough to generate meaningful discussion while being accessible to students without extensive project management experience.
You can modify the scenario or adjust the time allocations based on your specific class needs.

Learning Objectives
-------------------------------------------------

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

  - Identify all relevant stakeholders for a project
  - Categorize stakeholders by influence and interest levels
  - Create a comprehensive stakeholder register
  - Develop appropriate engagement strategies for different stakeholder types

**Scenario:** Campus Sustainability Initiative

Your team has been assigned to manage a comprehensive sustainability project for your CEGEP Heritage College main campus. The project aims to reduce the campus carbon footprint by 30% over the next two years and increase recycling proccess efficiency through various initiatives including:

  - Installing solar panels on the building
  - Implementing a campus-wide recycling program
  - Creating sustainable dining options in cafeterias
  - Establishing student-led sustainability clubs

**Budget:** $2.5 million

**Timeline:** 24 months

**Expected Impact:** 5,000+ students, 800+ staff and faculty

Part 1: Stakeholder Identification

Part 2: Stakeholder Analysis Matrix
-------------------------------------------------

**Instructions:** Plot each stakeholder on the matrix below based on their level of influence (ability to impact project success with performance) and interest (how much the project affects them).

Influence/Interest Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **HIGH INTEREST, LOW INFLUENCE** | **HIGH INTEREST, HIGH INFLUENCE** |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Keep Satisfied                   | Manage Closely                    |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **LOW INTEREST, LOW INFLUENCE**  |  **LOW INTEREST, HIGH INFLUENCE** |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
|  Monitor                         |  Keep Informed                    |
+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

**Quadrant Definitions:**

  - **Manage Closely:** High influence, high interest - key stakeholders requiring active management
  - **Keep Informed:** High influence, low interest - keep satisfied with minimal effort
  - **Keep Satisfied:** Low influence, high interest - show consideration for their concerns
  - **Monitor:** Low influence, low interest - minimal effort, monitor for changes

Part 3: Stakeholder Register
-------------------------------------------------

**Instructions:** Select your top 3 most critical stakeholders and complete the register below.

+---+------------------+-------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+   
| # | Stakeholder Name | Role/Organization | Influence Level (1-5) | Interest Level (1-5) | Key Concerns/Expectations | Engagement Strategy |
+===+==================+===================+=======================+======================+===========================+=====================+
| 1 |                  |                   |                       |                      |                           |                     |
+---+------------------+-------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
| 2 |                  |                   |                       |                      |                           |                     |
+---+------------------+-------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
| 3 |                  |                   |                       |                      |                           |                     |
+---+------------------+-------------------+-----------------------+----------------------+---------------------------+---------------------+
